#### Assignment Overview

The following assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python [1]. You are required to create a Jupyter [2] notebook explaining the use of the package, including detailed explanations of at least ﬁve of the distributions provided for in the package. There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in your Jupyter notebook. 

1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.

2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions. 

3. Explain the use and purpose of at least ﬁve “Distributions” functions. 

4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

#### Contents of repository

The repository contains:

* `README.md` file
* `numpy.random.ipynb` — jupyter notebook contains solution to the assignment
* `requirements.txt` — contains list of packages need to run the notebook
* `.gitignore` — contains list of files that have to be ignore

#### Required software

The following software is required to run the notebook:

* `git` — open source software to download the repository onto computer[3]
* `python` — Python Programming Language
* `Numpy. Matplotlib. Seaborn. Jupyter` — python packages used to make an investigation into the numpy.random package[5,6,7] 

The following command will install the packages according to the configuration file

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or alternatively 

* `Anaconda` — Individual edition of Anaconda can be install to get all of the relevant software.[4]

#### Instructions for downloading repository

At github repository [Programming for Data Analysis](https://github.com/mizydorek/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Assignment) click on the green `Code` button to copy the link. Open command line(windows) or terminal(osx/linux), navigate to the selected directory and enter the command `git clone` folowed copied the URL. Alternatively copy the whole command below:

```
git clone https://github.com/mizydorek/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Assignment
```

The whole repository will be cloned down onto current working directory.

#### How to run the jupyter notebook

From there run `jupyter notebook` command on the command line/terminal. This will open Jupyter in the browser. The notebook containing solution that is called `numpy.random.ipynb` can be opened by clicking on it.
Once opened, select `Restart and Run All` from Kernel sub-menu to run the jupyter notebook.

#### Viewing the Notebook 

The notebook can be viewed online either on th [github](https://github.com/mizydorek/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Assignment/blob/main/numpy.random.ipynb) or by accessing through Jupyter Notebooks viewer  [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mizydorek/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Assignment/blob/main/numpy.random.ipynb).
